This code is through image fusion to do batch synthesis of smoke images.

First, you need to install open-cv.

Second, three folders are created under the repository, "src" for clean images (smoke-free); "smoke" represents the layer of smoke; "new_img" stands for blurred image (added smoke).

It is important to note that the image files in the folders "src" and "smoke" need to be named one by one.

Next,run addsmoke.py.

Finally,you can see the results in the folder as "new_img".
